Dropping a table in PostgreSQL also deletes all the indexes associated with that table, including those created automatically for constraints like PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE. When you drop a table, PostgreSQL automatically cleans up all associated resources, including:

- Indexes (both manually and automatically created).
- Constraints.
- Triggers.
- Rules.
